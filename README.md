Technique
-----
1. the mouse over the pic chart slice, the bar chart also change the color.

Design
-----
1.Choosing different charts according to different attributes we want to visualize. 
2.Choosing the good size to show the world map.  
3.I carefully choose the color in each chart to better show the data. It is effective because only around 12 bins of color can be distinguished in the human view.
