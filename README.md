Assignment 4 - Visualizations and Multiple Views  
===

The following is an example of coordinated multiple views. I decided to have an interactive world map where different visualization types are linked together to display a variety of information about every country in the world.

Visualization Details
--

For this project, I decided to utilize three different visualization techniques that display information about a particular country. In particular, the data being displayed is birthrate calculated in number of births divided by 1000 population, evolution of Gross Domestic Product from 1960 to 2017, and finally the geographical location of every country through a map. Unfortunately, I was unable to find all the necessary data on a single dataset, so I had to pull information from different datasets and form my own. The following datasets make up the overall data visualized in this project. 
- *factbook.csv* contains the birth rate information for each country (obtained from https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets)
- *gdp.csv* contains the gdp growth for every country since 1960 (obtained from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd)
- *map.json* contains all the additional data for the map to work (obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andybarefoot/andybarefoot-www/master/maps/mapdata/custom50.json)

To represent the birthrate I decided to use a barchart, where each country is placed on the x-axis and the birthrate value on the y-axis. As seen in the image below, the number countries surpasses the length of the x-axis, for that reason the dragging function was added in order to scroll left and righgt in the x-axis to see all the countries. When the user hovers over a specific bar, the birthrate value is pappears on the top of the bar.

For the gdp growth from 1960 to 2017 information I decided to use multiple line chart, as it makes it easier to visualize information over time. Each line is color coded as ordinal data with the d3 color scheme function. When the user hovers over a particular line, it will automatically change the opacity of such line in contrast to the rest, to make it easier to differentiate. Additionally the name of the country that line represent will apear on the top of the screen.

Finally, I used a world map to display geographical information. When the user hovers over a country on the map, a label with the name of the country will apear. Moreover, there is an additional zoom function thatzooms into the specific country the user has clicked on.

Coordinated Multiple Views
--
The different visualizations are interconnected by intereaction, meaning that user interaction in any of the them will cause the other two to change, hence making it easier for the user to view different statistics about a country with one single click. For intance, clicking on a specific country on the map will make the multi line chart to highlight the speific line of that country, and similarly with the barchart. The process is the same for the barchart and the line chart, since clicking a specific line or chart, will cause the map to zoom into the corresponding country. See below:

Technical Achievements
---
- Synchronizing all the different datasets into a common array of hashmap data structure. It was particularly challenging since all the datasets were organized differently, so it took a lot of trial and error to get all the data in the correct index and format. 

- Linking visualizations was particularly challenging. I learned to use unique IDs based on the specific country for every bar line and geolocation. That way, I was able to link them all together and reference them individually. Moreove, by being tied to a specifc country id, an event ocurring on one of the visualiztions will propagate to all other visualizations that carry the same id.

- Making the scrollable barchart work smoothly with the country dataset I was using was tricky at first, and it took a good amount of trials and errors to tune it, in a way that the scrollable bar could be updated withthe d3drag() function using the appropiate fields forom the input dataset.

- Plotting a large number of lines in the line chart, using a single svg.append() function, making the process of linking each line to a country's bar and geolocation much easier. At first I used a for loop for this process since the array of data I was using (gdp) was a sub array of the main hashmap. However this approach did not allow for individual recognition of a single path. 

- Adjusting the dimensions of the map to keep the 2:1 ratio. This proved particularly tricky when tweaking the initial zoom.

Design Achievments
---

- Plotting a multiline chart with such a large number of lines on one plot. and still make it possible for the user to select individual paths and easily recognize which country they belong to.  

- Arranging all the different elements on the screen, so each svg can sit on top of an indivdual div, makign it easier to resize elements. 

- Adding labels to each element on the screen makes it easier for the user to see a particular value by hovering over with the mouse. This is also very convenient, because it indicates the user whether or not the pointer is on the object and can be clicked. This makes the whole interaction more intuitive.
