I get US mass shooting dataset from kaggle and visualized it by multiple views.

- US map represents the shooting in all states. 
- Bubble chart represents the cause of shootings.
- Bar chart represents shootings every year from 1983 to 2017.

When you click a state on map, bubble chart will show the cause of shootings in that state and Bar chart show how many shootings happened in that year. If you click a bubble which represent a type of cause, the map will show all the shootings by that cause over the country and bar chart shows that kind of shooting each year. If you click a year in bar chart, the map will show how many shootings happend in each state in that year and bubble chart will show all the cause in that year.
