Data
----
Find the raw data from kaggle, in the data directory.
Use python to analysis the raw data first, get the clean data, and split to the yearsdata.


Description
----
For this homework, get three views, are pie chart, bar chart and would map.
1. use pie chart to show the data that in different years, the percentage of car makes.
2. use bar chart to show the data that the total sales of all the car makes.
3. use choropleth world map to show the data that in different years, which countery sales how many cars.


Technique
-----
1. the mouse over the pic chart slice, the bar chart also change the color.
2. draw the choropleth world map with data.
3. use other app to first filter the data and analysis it get the clean data.
4. try to do the interactive bar chart with the world map, but fails, want to do map update and bar update with the same button, however fails.



Design
-----
1.Choosing different charts according to different attributes we want to visualize. 
2.Choosing the good size to show the world map.  
3.I carefully choose the color in each chart to better show the data. It is effective because only around 12 bins of color can be distinguished in the human view.
